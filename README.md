# Discord Logger

Discord bot using the Discord.py API to record user data for the application's communities.

## Current Version (v2.0)

- Discord Logger records and stores:
  - Discord IDs and current Discord usernames
  - Booleans as members join the server
  - Booleans as members join voice channels
  - Integers as members send messages

*Discord Logger can only record data from channels that it can see*

## How To Use

1. In CMD/Terminal, ```git clone https://github.com/SamJSui/Discord-Logger``` to clone the files to your current directory
2. In the directory, create a ```.env``` file and type ```DISCORD_TOKEN=...``` with '...' replaced by your Discord Bot Token
3. In CMD/Terminal, ```python main.py``` to start the program

## Goal

I created this bot as a Data Science project to record the activity of my friends and I on a platform that we all use. I wanted to be able to store this data into a ```.csv``` and sort the information, allowing my friends and I to reflect on how often we talked to each other virtually (This idea came from our experience with COVID-19 applying restrictions).
