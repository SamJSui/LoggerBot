# Discord Logger

Discord bot using the Discord.py API to record user data for the application's communities.

## Current Version (v2.1.3)

- Discord Logger records and stores:
  - Dates of Activity
  - Discord IDs and current Discord usernames
  - Durations of time in a voice channel
  - Integers of messages sent per day
- Discord Logger (*To Be Continued*)
  - Send a graph of messages

*Discord Logger can only record data from channels that it can see*

## How To Use

1. In CMD/Terminal, ```git clone https://github.com/SamJSui/Discord-Logger``` to clone the files to your current directory
2. In the directory, create a ```.env``` file and type ```DISCORD_TOKEN=...``` with '...' replaced by your Discord Bot Token
3. In CMD/Terminal, ```python main.py``` to start the program

## Goal

- During the peak of COVID-19, in-person meetings were seldom held. This led many circles of friends to Discord or other online apps.
- This Data Science project was created to collect activity within the Discord server, allowing us to reflect on our past, in the future, in the form of data.

### Edits
